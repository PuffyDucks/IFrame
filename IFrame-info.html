  <h3>Put a link in the text box up there and press Go or enter. Links need http:// at the beginning or else they won't work. Some websites, like Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Spotify won't work unfortunately. Bing works, however. There are also bookmarks on the bottom of this page. </br></br></br></br></br>
